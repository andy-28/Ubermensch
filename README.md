This is a Next.js + Prisma + SQLite project with authentication flows and a Task MVP.
The Task MVP page is available at `/tasks` and supports list, create, and status update.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Prisma Initialization

1. Ensure `.env` has a SQLite `DATABASE_URL` (for example: `file:./prisma/dev.db`).
2. Run migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

3. Generate Prisma Client (if not already generated by migrate):

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

4. Optional: seed test tasks:

```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

## Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/tasks` to test the Task MVP.

## Quality Check

npm run lint
```
